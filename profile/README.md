## Penn AInSights
Penn Medicine’s AInSights is a cloud-based machine learning platform accessible by clinicians that supports multiple machine learning algorithms for real-time image analysis. The technology was invented by Ari Borthakur, PhD, MBA, Associate Director, Center for Magnetic Resonance & Optical Imaging, Department of Radiology, Walter Witschey, PhD, Associate Professor of Radiology in Penn Medicine, and colleagues in the Department of Radiology and UPHA-Corp Information Systems.

PCI and the inventors worked together to create a video that explains their AI technology and its ability to reduce the burden on radiologists. Traditionally, radiologists have to review images manually, which is time-consuming and increases the risk of missing details. To solve this issue, AInsights provides radiologists with a real-time AI analysis of multiple medical images at once, which speeds up the diagnosis process, improves accuracy and eliminates the need for expensive hardware. Charles Kahn, MD, MS, Professor and Vice Chair, Radiology, in Penn Medicine and also an inventor is featured in the video, showcasing how AInSights works on a CT scan.
